# JPMC Task 1
Task 1 of the JPMC software engineering program

## Purpose
We want to process the data feed of stock A and stock Bâ€™s price to enable us to analyse when trading for the stock should occur.

## Acceptance Criteria
* `getDataPoint` function should return correct tuple of stock name, bid_price, ask_price and price. Note: price of a stock = average of bid and ask
* `getRatio` function should return the ratio of the two stock prices
* `main` function should output correct stock info, prices and ratio
